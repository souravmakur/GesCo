# GesCo
GesCo is the short form for Gesture Recognition which is a technique that allows you to determine hand gestures from a hand pose model. 
This could be used to control computer input, detect sign language and for active gameplay.
We will be using the Hands model from mediapipe solutions to detect hands, it is a palm detection model that operates on the full image and returns an oriented hand bounding box.


In the proposed system, users can use four simple gestures to control the Media Player without physically 
touching the PC. Gesture is a symbol of physical behavior or emotional expression. It includes body 
gesture and hand gesture.

It falls into two categories: static gesture and dynamic gesture. For the former, the posture of the body or 
the gesture of the hand denotes a sign. 

For the latter, the movement of the body or the hand conveys some messages. Gesture can be used as a tool 
of communication between computer and human.

It is greatly different from the traditional hardware-based methods and can accomplish human-computer 
interaction through gesture recognition. Gesture recognition determines the user intent through the 
recognition of the gesture or movement of the body or body parts.

In the past decades, many researchers have strived to improve the hand gesture recognition technology. 
Hand gesture recognition has great value in many applications such as sign language recognition, 
augmented reality (virtual reality), sign language interpreters for the disabled, and robot control.
